### Rocketseat weekly event to learn Web Development with Javascript, HTML and CSS.

## My learning ðŸ’»
Discovery: NLW was the boost I needed to start developing my own websites, I was lost on where to start and the event
I recognized myself in my goal, I understood the logic in the Front-end with an introduction in HTML and CSS, learning about tags and how they behave, how to use them and how they work and how
use of CSS for positioning, responsiveness and customization of the page layout, such as the useful font and its size. In the last two days of the event Mayk Brito (Professor)
introduced about how the Backend and database works using node.js and SQlite, creating a server, and showing how to use and make a database.
Some lessons given in classes is always to stay focused, never lose focus on your goals and to be a good programmer practice a lot, specialize in technology
that best fits what you want to work with and hand in the code!
Some of the libraries used were: express and nunjucks.
